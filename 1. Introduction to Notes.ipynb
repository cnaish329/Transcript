    "## What is Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language with integrated semantics primarily for web and app development. This statement is quite technical, so lets break it down. Python is classed as an object-orientated programming language, this is one of 6 main \"programming paradigms (or languages)\", a programing paradigm is a fundemental style by which you build the structure and elements of a programming language. The 6 main paradigms are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Imperative**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Object-oriented**\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Symbolic**\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Declarative**\n",
    "\n",
    "6) **Functional**\n",
    "\n",
    "This course focuses on python, therefore only object-orientated paradigm's will be discussed. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a type of programming in which the programmers define not only the data type of a data structure but also the types of operations/functions that can be applied to the data structure. In this way the data structure becomes an object which includes both the data and the functions. Additionally, in such programming languages, programmers can create relationships between one object and another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before delving deeper it is important to understand what and the differences between objects and classes in OOP. A class is often thought of as a type of blue print (lets say a blue print for a house), the blue print doesn't actually do anything but simply presents a set of instructions from which you can produce something tangible. In programming the class ( or blueprint) is a template (which can contain both data and code), then more code can be written to use the class to create a new object. A good example would be a class is a blue print for employee data, containing names and email adddresses; from this we create an object of name \"Grant\" and email address grant86@yahoo.com. Later  the code can be made to produce a different object from the class (i.e can create multiple objects which contain inforamtion from the original class). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the difference between classes and objects is known we can move onto the main concepts of object oriented programming (OOP). These are often summarised in literature through the 4 pillars of OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstraction** = is a process where you show only “relevant” data and “hide” unnecessary details of an object from the user. Consider your mobile phone, you just need to know what buttons are to be pressed to send a message or make a call, What happens when you press a button, how your messages are sent, how your calls are connected is all abstracted away from the user.\n",
    "- **Encapsulation** = is the process of combining data and functions into a single unit called class. In Encapsulation, the data is not accessed directly; it is accessed through the functions present inside the class. In simpler words, attributes of the class are kept private and public getter and setter methods are provided to manipulate these attributes. Thus, encapsulation makes the concept of data hiding possible.\n",
    "- **Inheritance** = enables new classes to receive—or inherit—the properties and methods of existing classes.\n",
    "- **Polymorphism** = polymorphism refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class. More specifically, it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes. For example, given a base class shape, polymorphism enables the programmer to define different area methods for any number of derived classes, such as circles, rectangles and triangles. No matter what shape an object is, applying the area method to it will return the correct results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next bit of technical language in the definition of python is the use of \"high-level programming language\". Essentially, a high level language is one that is easyer for humans to understand/use and a low level is one that is closer to what computers understand. High level languages have the advantage of being easier to program, however, they are often less effient and take longer to run (this is not always true as effiency is heavily dependant on the code itself). As a general rule high level languages are used if it is the programmers time that is the limiting factor and lower level if computational time is the limiting factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, enough with the technical detail of what python is, lets take a look at the basics of programming. In the following section the basic concepts of programming in python and how to apply them to tackle problems will be breifly overviewed with a number of examples and live code. Notably this assumes a small level of python experience and if you are reading this and have no experience with python I suggest undertaking the following 4 hour python programming intro course on data camp:\n",
